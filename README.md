## pihole-dnscrypt

- Allows you to block adverts and malware at a DNS level. This is much more effective than using ad-blockers. All devices on the network can be protected using this measure (as opposed to say just a browser on a single desktop PC).
- Allows you to block addition sites which you want.
- Gives you visibility to what is happening on your own network.
- Allows you to leverage more secure DNS technologies such as DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) for all devices.

## How to use
- Run setup.sh
- Configure .env and dnscrypt-proxy.toml
- Run sudo docker compose up -d
